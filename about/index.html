    Hi! I'm a fourth-year student at University of Waterloo, studying Statistics with a minor in Computer Science.
    <p>Analyzing data and using it for predictions and modelling is something that interests me - that is one of the reasons I started this blog.
    I also wanted to see if I could use what I learned in school for real-world applications. Lastly, learning by doing is one of my 
    preferred methods of learning, and this blog is an excellent place to get my feet wet in the vast world of data science.</p>
    <p>Thanks for stopping by and reading my spiel. Hope you found the content interesting and enjoyable.</p>
    <p>If you want to learn more about my experiences or ask any questions, feel free to email me for a resume or check out my LinkedIn page - these links are available in the <b>Contact</b> section.</p>
